               <h1>App creation: BUD (habit building app)</h1>
               <p>Positive habits to improve your lifestyle or achieve personal goals are difficult to implement. It can be emotionally and physically challenging. We have created an app that allows users to be apart of a community of like minded individuals who want to achieve their goals through habitual development.</p>

                    <h1>Website redesign: Department of Education</h1>
                    <p>Problem: The government website for the Department of Education website is a vital resources of those who need important information on education. Unfortunately, relies heavily on bulk amounts of text with little visuals to make it digestible.</p>
              <p>Solution: The increased use of coloured imagery, iconography and the inclusion of rounded edged components create a lighter visual tone for the site. Additionally an IA restructuring backed by user testing creates a user centric navigational experience</p>

                    <p>Problem: Despite the RSPCA being the largest organisation for animal welfare, the current website is overwhelming users with large chunks of text and disorganised information hierarchy</p>
                    <p>Solution: By enhancing the presentation of information on the website, users can get into contact with the relevant people and information to aid in the fight for safe and just treatment of animals.</p>

                <p>The first stage of conducting user research involves brainstorming. This step clearly defines the problem, any assumptions and insights the researchers have. We generate hypothesis, user insight, and problem statements, and proto-personas.</p>

                     <p>A interview plan is generated with questions broken up into sections that explore all aspects of the concept we want to develop into a product. Questions are curated to explore users pinpoints and desires. To ensure that the user answers questions genuinely, we limit the number and duration of the interviews.</p>
